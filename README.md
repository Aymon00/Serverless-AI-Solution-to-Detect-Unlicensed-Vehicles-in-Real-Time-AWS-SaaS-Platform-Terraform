# ðŸš€ Overview
This project provides a scalable, serverless AI solution using AWS services to process video streams, analyze vehicle images, and detect unlicensed vehicles.

âœ… Real-time processing: AWS Kinesis and Lambda for fast video stream analysis.
âœ… Efficient data storage: DynamoDB for metadata and S3 for images.
âœ… Event-driven architecture: Uses SNS and EventBridge for notifications and automation.
âœ… Secure API exposure: AWS API Gateway enables external access.
